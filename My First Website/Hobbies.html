  <p> My second favorite hobby is snowboarding due to the fact theres endless oppourtinites. From learning more to doing tricks theres always something that you can do while snowboarding <br>
  <p> Although going up to Redlodge can be very expensive for lift tickets its something that is always worth doing, not only going snowboarding but roadtrips can be very fun up there.</p. <br>
